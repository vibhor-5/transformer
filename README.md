# transformer

Welcome to the **transformer** repository!This is the architectural implementation of the transformer architecture proposed in the [Attention is All you Need Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et. al

## Overview

This repository is written in Python and is intended to serve as a foundation for building, experimenting with, or extending transformer-based architectures. While the specific project purpose and features are not documented, this repo can be used as a template or starting point for your own transformer implementations in Python.

## Features

- 100% Python codebase.
- Public and open for forking or contributions.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibhor-5/transformer.git
cd transformer
```

# This is onlt the architecture of the model implemented for a clearer understanding of the model and the self attention process .

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## License

This project currently does not have a license specified. Please add a license file to clarify usage and contribution rights.
